## Project Overview

The project aims to provide a comprehensive set of examples and utilities for handling and manipulating matrices in Python. This includes basic matrix operations, advanced topics like matrix decompositions, and even applications like matrix visualization and optimization.

Each script in the project is designed to be standalone, demonstrating specific concepts or operations. The `utils` folder contains reusable functions that are imported across various scripts for common operations.

## Usage

To use any script, navigate to its directory and run the script with Python. For example:

```bash
python matrix_representation/matrix_inverse_example.py
